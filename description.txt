Agents:
    -main agent
    -small agent1
    -small agent2

State:
    - for the small agents, the deck of the cards, with the winning = 0
    - for the main agent, the life is at maximum

Environment:
    - game of cards combined with the life of the main agent

Action:
    -send card to the  main agent and receive the status of the card.

Perception:
    - if a small agent card is smaller than the great agent card, win else loose
    - if the main agent is left with life 0, the agent is dead and the small agents win.

Goal:
    - to win as many hands as possible and to beat the main agent.

Problem definition:
    In this project, I developed a game a cards, where the higher card wins and deals damage to the main agent.

MAS Specification:
    - bussiness logic
    
Agent's role:
    -Main agent reprezents the agent that must be beaten.
    -Smaller agents reprezents the  agents who are trying to beat the Main agent.
